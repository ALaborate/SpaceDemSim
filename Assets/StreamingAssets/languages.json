    "Project SpaceDemSim is a mini game, as part of my masters thesis @KUBG (kubg.edu.ua).\n\nThe objective of a thesis is to rank different methods of inputing rotation by their conveniece. In order to come closer to objective truth, I need some data. So I created this app. Its a game for users and a tool for me. As you play, it sends to me information about your speed and type of your input. I plan to use it to determine relative convinience of input methods. No confidential data is stored or transfered (because it will not help me achive stated goal). On that note, I deeply appreciate that you devote your time to my (questinable in its value) attempt on  doing research. \n\nI think I will update \"gaming\" part of this app in the future for two reasons. First - I'd like to make games, preferably with some ambition for a positive impact. But my every project is a sketchy prototype that can not be interesting because it is narrow and hard to use. With this simple (very simple in its core mechanic!) game I have good chances to finish it to the point when it is at least usable. I'd like to try. Second reason is that the better game I have - the more data I collect. And the more data I have - the more accurate results I could expect. \n\nI'm Gleb Kosiachenko aka OMOH98 and this is not my only nickname. If you need to contact me, try t.me/OMOH98 or hykosiachenko.fitu20@kubg.edu.ua. \n\nI plan to make this game free and open-source for reasons that are out of scope of this note. Try googling it on github.com yourself.

Its kind of hard to spot a mine when its far away from us. So this hunt is an ongoing and persistent process: we see thouse mines that come closer, destroy them and than others come. \n\nYou always have a choice. For now your options are to join this cause or stand back. If you join, you will become a part of one of hunter ships crew. Thouse ships usualy warp to a suspected location of a mine so, that their velocities are syncronized. Your job is to establish visual contact and confirm presence of a mine. Than you need to lighten up the mine with specific radio signal. After short time ship locks on it. This allows to fire a missile and destroy what may otherwise become someone death. \n\nIf you do your job - you become more experienced. In these circumstances experience is about your reliability in the eyes of command rather than about skills. As command deem you more trustworthy, they are more likely to assign you on different missions which may just what you want. \n\nThats it. Next steps are up to you and whatever choise you would make, I am sure you will manage. Nevertheless, good luck: it won't hurt. ": "Итак, тебя интересует, что тебе предстоит делать, не так ли? И, что более важно, почему. Это правильные вопрсы, очень правильные, я так думаю.\n\nСейчас ты почти готов погрузиться в мир игры. В этом мире есть история: когда-то была большая и страшная война. К сожалению, войны случаются время от времени. В какой-то момент этой войны, одна из сторон потеряла надежду. Нет, они не проиграли, даже не близко, но становилось все очевиднее, что их шансы выиграть все более призрачны. К сожалению, они были чересчур уверены в своей правоте. Поэтому начали искать способы выиграть независимо от цены. Они перестали уважать своих врагов, и, в какой-то момент - заботиться о них. Это может показаться неотвратимым, ведь зачем кому-либо заботиться о своих врагах? В самом деле, смысла нет, но в процессе вражды с кем-либо, сложнее переживать о своем будущем и будущем потомков, чем о сущности, с которой ты постоянно в контакте в данный момент - своем враге. Забота о нем - это маркер, по которому худо-бедно можно судить об адекватности.\n\nПо итогу, эта безнадежная сторона, не думающая ни о врагах, ни о нас, ни о чем либо вообще помимо своих целей, делала много всякого. В частности, они минировали космос с максимально возможной интенсивностью. И эти мины по сей день плавают в межзвездном пространстве. Те, что подплывают ближе, несут смертельную угрозу, особенно учитывая то, что относительные скорости в космосе обычно находятся за пределами выживания. Мы охотимся на эти мины. Заметить любую из них - непростая задача, которую становится возможно решить лишь на относительно близких расстояниях. Так эта охота идет, и будет продолжаться еще долго: мы обнаруживаем цели поблизости, уничтожаем их, а за это время появляются новые. \n\nУ тебя всегда есть выбор. Сейчас ты можешь либо присоединиться к нашему делу, либо воздержаться. При выборе первого варианта ты станешь частью команды корабля-истребителя. Эти корабли получают целеуказания с возможными локациями мин, перемещаются по ним так, что скорости корабля и цели становятся сопоставимы и, в результате, уничтожают. Твоя работа будет заключаться в том, чтоб обнаружить цель визуально и подтвердить, что это действительно мина. После этого нужно подсветить цель радиосигналом, чтоб апаратура корабля захватила ее на автосопровождение. Это позволит обстрелять цель ракетами и уничтожить то, что в противном случае будет нести кому-то смерть.\n\nЕсли будешь делать работу - будешь становиться более опытным. В данном случае, опыт является скорее показателем доверия со стороны коммандования, чем оценкой умений. Чем более надежным и предсказуемым ты представляешься коммандованию, тем более вероятно они тебя направят на другие, более ответственные, нужные и интересные миссии.\n\nВот как-то так. Дальше выбор за тобой. Думаю, что ты справишься в любом случае. Но тем не меннее, удачи! Она не помешает.",
    "Project SpaceDemSim is a mini game, as part of my masters thesis @KUBG (kubg.edu.ua).\n\nThe objective of a thesis is to rank different methods of inputing rotation by their conveniece. In order to come closer to objective truth, I need some data. So I created this app. Its a game for users and a tool for me. As you play, it sends to me information about your speed and type of your input. I plan to use it to determine relative convinience of input methods. No confidential data is stored or transfered (because it will not help me achive stated goal). On that note, I deeply appreciate that you devote your time to my (questinable in its value) attempt on  doing research. \n\nI think I will update \"gaming\" part of this app in the future for two reasons. First - I'd like to make games, preferably with some ambition for a positive impact. But my every project is a sketchy prototype that can not be interesting because it is narrow and hard to use. With this simple (very simple in its core mechanic!) game I have good chances to finish it to the point when it is at least usable. I'd like to try. Second reason is that the better game I have - the more data I collect. And the more data I have - the more accurate results I could expect. \n\nI'm Gleb Kosiachenko aka OMOH98 and this is not my only nickname. If you need to contact me, try t.me/OMOH98 or hykosiachenko.fitu20@kubg.edu.ua. \n\nI plan to make this game free and open-source for reasons that are out of scope of this note. Try googling it on github.com yourself. ": "Проект SpaceDemSim - это маленькая игра, созданнкая как часть моей магистерской дипломной работы в KUBG (kubg.edu.ua).\n\nРабота исследовательская и цель ее в том, чтобы ранжировать различные методы ввода поворота камеры (в общем случае - двумерного вектора, который может использоваться как угодно) по удобству для пользователя. Ну и понятно, что для этого нужно знать что-то о пользовтелях, для чего я и создал приложение, являющееся игрой для игроков и, одновремено, инструментом сбора данных для меня. Ты играешь, а программа по итогу пересылает мне данные о том, каким типом ввода ты пользовался, и насколько быстро выполнял задачи. И никаких конфиденциальных данных! Они мне никак не помогут, место у меня ограничено. К сломву, спасибо за время, приделенное моей попытке провести исследование. Несмотря сомнительную ценность для общества, оно важно для меня в первую очередь как источник опыта.\n\nДумаю, что в будущем я буду обновлять игровую часть этого приложения. По двум причинам. Во-первых, я бы хотел делать игры, желательно несущие положительное влияние. Но на данный момент все мои проекты - это миниатюрные прототипы которые просто не могут быть широко интересны уже потому, что неудобны. Простота этой игры дает мне шанс закончить ее хотя бы до такого состояния, чтоб ей было возможно и хоть чуть-чуть интересно пользоваться. Хотел бы попробовать его реализовать. Ну а во-вторых, чем лучше игра - тем больше данных я могу собрать. А чем больше данных - тем более точны и весомы результаты исследования, что лишним не будет.\n\nЯ - Глеб Косяченко, широко известен в узких кругах под ником OMOH98 (и не только лиш этим). Если есть желание сконтачиться со мной по поводу этой игры в частности, воспользуйся t.me/OMOH98, или hykosiachenko.fitu20@kubg.edu.ua.\n\nЯ планирую выпустить эту игру как свободное ПО с открытым исходным кодом. Уже сейчас можно попробовать загуглить его на гитхабе.",
